# Payment processing example: .NET

There are two sections in this ReadMe.
* [Setup](#setup) - Provides instructions for you to download and run the app.
* [Application Flow](#application-flow) - Provides an overview of how the Square Payment form integrates in the ASP.NET app.

## Setup

1. Open `./appsettings.json`. Specify `Environment`, and replace `AccessToken`, `LocationId`, and `ApplicationId` with your sandbox or production credentials. You can get your credentials from your Square application created at [Square Developer Portal](https://developer.squareup.com/apps).
<b>WARNING</b>: never upload `appsettings.json` with your credentials or access token.

1. Esure you have `dotnet` instealled (`dotnet --version` in your terminal). If not, please download [.net core 2.0+](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/)

1. Open your terminal, and run the following to build the app:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

1. Then, to run the server:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

1. Open a browser and navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

1. Test with different payment options. For more information on testing in sandbox mode, follow the guide: [Testing using the API sandbox](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/testing/sandbox)


## Application Flow

This ASP.NET Core Razor application implements the Square Online payment solution to charge a payment source (debit card, credit card, ACH transfers, and digital wallet payment methods).

Square Online payment solution is a 2-step process:

1. Generate a token - Use the [Square Web Payments SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments) to accept payment source information and generate a secure payment token.


   NOTE: The Web Payments SDK renders the card inputs and digital wallet buttons that make up the payment form and returns a secure payment token. For more information, see the [Web Payments SDK Overview](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/overview).


2. Charge the payment source using the token - Using a server-side component, that uses the Connect V2
   **Payments** API, you charge the payment source using the secure payment token.

The following sections describe how the C# sample implements these steps.

### Step 1: Generate a Token

When the page loads it renders the form defined in the **Pages/index.cshtml** file. The page also downloads and executes the following scripts:

**Square Web Payments SDK** - It is a library that provides the Payment objects you use in sq-payment-flow.js. For more information about the library, see [Web Payments SDK Reference](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments).

**sq-payment-flow.js** - This code provides two things:

- Initializes objects for various supported payment methods including card payments, bank payments, and digital wallet payments. Each of the following files handles unique client logic for a specific payment method to generate a payment token:

  - `sq-card-pay.js`
  - `sq-ach.js`
  - `sq-google-pay.js`
  - `sq-apple-pay.js`

- Provides the global method that fires a `fetch` request to the server after receiving the payment token.
  ```javascript
  window.createPayment = async function(token) {
    const dataJsonString = JSON.stringify({
      token
    });

    try {
      const response = await fetch('process-payment', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: dataJsonString
      });

      const data = await response.json();

      if (data.errors && data.errors.length > 0) {
        if (data.errors[0].detail) {
          window.showError(data.errors[0].detail);
        } else {
          window.showError('Payment Failed.');
        }
      } else {
        window.showSuccess('Payment Successful!');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    }
  }
  ```

### Step 2: Charge the Payment Source Using the Token

All the remaining actions take place in the **Pages/ProcessPayment.cshtml.cs** file. This server-side component uses the Square .NET SDK library to call the Connect V2 **Payments** API to charge the payment source using the token as shown in the following code fragment.

### Step 2: Charge the Payment Source Using the Nonce
All the remaining actions take place in the **ProcessPayment.cshtml.cs**.  This server-side component uses the Square .NET SDK C# wrapper library to call the Connect V2 **Payments** API to charge the payment source using the nonce.
```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostAsync()
{
    var request = JObject.Parse(await new StreamReader(Request.Body).ReadToEndAsync());
    var token = (String)request["token"];
    var PaymentsApi = client.PaymentsApi;
    // Every payment you process with the SDK must have a unique idempotency key.
    // If you're unsure whether a particular payment succeeded, you can reattempt
    // it with the same idempotency key without worrying about double charging
    // the buyer.
    string uuid = NewIdempotencyKey();

    // Get the currency for the location
    var retrieveLocationResponse = await client.LocationsApi.RetrieveLocationAsync(locationId: locationId);
    var currency = retrieveLocationResponse.Location.Currency;

    // Monetary amounts are specified in the smallest unit of the applicable currency.
    // This amount is in cents. It's also hard-coded for $1.00,
    // which isn't very useful.
    var amount = new Money.Builder()
        .Amount(100L)
        .Currency(currency)
        .Build();

    // To learn more about splitting payments with additional recipients,
    // see the Payments API documentation on our [developer site]
    // (https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/overview).
    var createPaymentRequest = new CreatePaymentRequest.Builder(
        sourceId: token,
        idempotencyKey: uuid,
        amountMoney: amount)
        .Build();

    try
    {
        var response = await PaymentsApi.CreatePaymentAsync(createPaymentRequest);
        return new JsonResult(new { payment = response.Payment });
    }
    catch (ApiException e)
    {
        return new JsonResult(new { errors = e.Errors });
    }
}
```
