# Payment processing example: Python

This sample demonstrates processing card payments with Square Connect API, using the
Square Connect Python client library.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python >= 3.4

## Setup

### Install the Python client library

1. Make sure you have Python >= 3.4 installed from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Run the following command to install `squareup` package and other dependencies:

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Provide required credentials

Replace all your credentials in `config.ini`. Note that there's sandbox and
production credentials. Use `is_prod` (true/false) to choose between them.
Do not use quotes around the strings in the `config.ini` file.
(**WARNING**: never upload `config.ini` with your credentials/access_token.)

If you're just testing things out, it's recommended that you use your _sandbox_
credentials for now. See
[this article](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/testing/sandbox)
for more information on the API sandbox.

## Running the sample

From the sample's root directory, run:

    uvicorn main:app --reload

You can then visit `localhost:8000` in your browser to see the card form.

If you're using your sandbox credentials, you can test a valid credit card
transaction by providing the following card information in the form:

- Card Number: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
- Card CVV: `111`
- Card Expiration: `12/24` (Any time in the future)
- Card Postal Code: `12345` (Any valid US postal code)

You can find more testing values in this [article](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/testing/test-values)

**Note that if you are _not_ using your sandbox credentials and you enter _real_
credit card information, YOU WILL CHARGE THE CARD.**

## Application Flow

This Python application implements the Square Online payment solution to charge a payment source (debit card, credit card, ACH transfers, and digital wallet payment methods).

Square Online payment solution is a 2-step process:

1. Generate a token - Use the [Square Web Payments SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments) to accept payment source information and generate a secure payment token.

   NOTE: The Web Payments SDK renders the card inputs and digital wallet buttons that make up the payment form and returns a secure payment token. For more information, see the [Web Payments SDK Overview](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/overview).

2. Charge the payment source using the token - Using a server-side component, that uses the Connect V2
   **Payments** API, you charge the payment source using the secure payment token.

The following sections describe how the Python sample implements these steps.

### Step 1: Generate a Token

When the page loads it renders the form defined in the **main.py** file:

```python
@app.get("/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
def read_root():
    return generate_index_html()
```

which downloads and executes the following scripts:

**Square Web Payments SDK** - It is a library that provides the Payment objects you use in sq-payment-flow.js. For more information about the library, see [Web Payments SDK Reference](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments).

**sq-payment-flow.js** - This code provides two things:

- Initializes objects for various supported payment methods including card payments, bank payments, and digital wallet payments. Each of the following files handles unique client logic for a specific payment method to generate a payment token:

  - `sq-card-pay.js`
  - `sq-ach.js`
  - `sq-google-pay.js`
  - `sq-apple-pay.js`

- Provides the global method that fires a `fetch` request to the server after receiving the payment token.

  ```javascript
  window.createPayment = async function(token) {
    const dataJsonString = JSON.stringify({
      token
    });

    try {
      const response = await fetch('process-payment', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: dataJsonString
      });

      const data = await response.json();

      if (data.errors && data.errors.length > 0) {
        if (data.errors[0].detail) {
          window.showError(data.errors[0].detail);
        } else {
          window.showError('Payment Failed.');
        }
      } else {
        window.showSuccess('Payment Successful!');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    }
  }
  ```

### Step 2: Charge the Payment Source Using the Token

All the remaining actions take place in the **main.py** file. This server-side component uses the [Square Python SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/sdks/python) to call the Connect V2 **Payments** API to charge the payment source using the token as shown in the following code fragment.

```python
...
@app.post("/process-payment")
def create_payment(payment: Payment):
    logging.info("Creating payment")
    # Charge the customer's card
    create_payment_response = client.payments.create_payment(
        body={
            "source_id": payment.token,
            "idempotency_key": str(uuid.uuid4()),
            "amount_money": {
                "amount": 100,  # $1.00 charge
                "currency": ACCOUNT_CURRENCY,
            },
        }
    )

    logging.info("Payment created")
    if create_payment_response.is_success():
        return create_payment_response.body
    elif create_payment_response.is_error():
        return create_payment_response
...
```
