# Payment processing example: Java

This example hosts a payment form in Java. It is a Spring Boot app and requires Java 8 or newer. There are two sections in this ReadMe.

- [Setup](#setup) - Provides instructions for you to download and run the app.
- [Application Flow](#application-flow) - Provides an overview of how the Web Payments SDK integrates in the Java example.

## Setup

1. Create a Square application. If you haven't done this yet, you can quickly set one up in the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/apps).

1. This app runs from the command line using Maven. The application expects four environment variables
to be set: `ENVIRONMENT`, `SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID`, `SQUARE_LOCATION_ID` and `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, 
which correspond to either your sandbox or production credentials.
        <b>WARNING</b>: never save your credentials in your code.

1. Open the command line, and run the following command to start the app:

    ```bash
    ENVIRONMENT=<sandbox or production> SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=replace_me SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=replace_me SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=replace_me mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    NOTE: If the credentials are not set or are invalid, the app will fail during startup.
    
1. Open a browser and navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). The default port used is `5000`, but this can be configured in the `application.properties` file.

1. Test with different payment options. For more information on testing in sandbox mode, follow the guide: [Testing using the API sandbox](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/testing/sandbox).


## Application Flow

This Java web application implements the Square Online payment solution to charge a payment source (debit card, credit card, ACH transfers, and digital wallet payment methods).

Square Online payment solution is a 2-step process:

1. Generate a token - Use the [Square Web Payments SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments) to accept payment source information and generate a secure payment token.

   NOTE: The Web Payments SDK renders the card inputs and digital wallet buttons that make up the payment form and returns a secure payment token. For more information, see the [Web Payments SDK Overview](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/overview).

2. Charge the payment source using the token - Using a server-side component, that uses the Connect V2
   **Payments** API, you charge the payment source using the secure payment token.

The following sections describe how the Java sample implements these steps.

### Step 1: Generate a Token

When the page loads it renders the form defined in the **src/main/resources/templates/index.html** file. The page also downloads and executes the following scripts:

**Square Web Payments SDK** - It is a library that provides the Payment objects you use in sq-payment-flow.js. For more information about the library, see [Web Payments SDK Reference](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments).

**sq-payment-flow.js** - This code provides two things:

- Initializes objects for various supported payment methods including card payments, bank payments, and digital wallet payments. Each of the following files handles unique client logic for a specific payment method to generate a payment token:

  - `sq-card-pay.js`
  - `sq-ach.js`
  - `sq-google-pay.js`
  - `sq-apple-pay.js`

- Provides the global method that fires a `fetch` request to the server after receiving the payment token.
  ```javascript
  window.createPayment = async function(token) {
    const dataJsonString = JSON.stringify({
      token
    });

    try {
      const response = await fetch('process-payment', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: dataJsonString
      });

      const data = await response.json();

      if (data.errors && data.errors.length > 0) {
        if (data.errors[0].detail) {
          window.showError(data.errors[0].detail);
        } else {
          window.showError('Payment Failed.');
        }
      } else {
        window.showSuccess('Payment Successful!');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    }
  }
  ```

### Step 2: Charge the Payment Source Using the Token

All the remaining actions take place in the **src/main/java/com/squareup/connectexamples/ecommerce/Main.java** file. 
This server-side component uses the [Square Java SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/sdks/java) 
to call the Connect V2 **Payments** API to charge the payment source using the token as shown in the following code fragment.

```java
@PostMapping("/process-payment")
@ResponseBody PaymentResult processPayment(@RequestBody TokenWrapper tokenObject)
  throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
  // To learn more about splitting payments with additional recipients,
  // see the Payments API documentation on our [developer site]
  // (https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/overview).

  // Get currency for location
  RetrieveLocationResponse locationResponse = getLocationInformation(squareClient).get();
  String currency = locationResponse.getLocation().getCurrency();

    Money bodyAmountMoney = new Money.Builder()
        .amount(100L)
        .currency(currency)
        .build();

    CreatePaymentRequest createPaymentRequest = new CreatePaymentRequest.Builder(
        tokenObject.getToken(),
        UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
        bodyAmountMoney)
        .build();

  PaymentsApi paymentsApi = squareClient.getPaymentsApi();
    return paymentsApi.createPaymentAsync(createPaymentRequest).thenApply(result -> {
      return new PaymentResult("SUCCESS", null);
    }).exceptionally(exception -> {
      System.out.println("Failed to make the request");
      System.out.printf("Exception: %s%n", exception.getMessage());
      // NOTE: Can pass in error messages to be presented in the front end. For simplicity,
      // we just hardcoded a simple string for now.
      return new PaymentResult("FAILURE", Collections.singletonList("errorMessage"));
    }).join();
}
```
