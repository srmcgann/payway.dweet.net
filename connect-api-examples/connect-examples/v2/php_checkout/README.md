[here](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

2. Run the following command from the directory containing `composer.json`:

```

In order for the example to work, you must edit the file called `.env` with your application credentials and environment configuration.

Open your [application dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/). Now supply either production, sandbox, or both credentials. Open this file and update the following variables:
* WARNING: never upload .env with your credential/access_token

|------------------------|:---------|-----------------|
| ENVIRONMENT            | `string` | `production` or `sandbox` depending on what type of endpoint you want to hit. For testing purposes please use the sandbox mode (already configured in the `.env`)   |
