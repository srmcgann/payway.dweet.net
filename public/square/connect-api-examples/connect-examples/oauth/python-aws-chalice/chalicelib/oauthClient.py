def conduct_authorize_url(state):
  '''Conduct a Square authorization url 

  This method creates a Square authroization url that takes client to Square
  authorization page to finish OAuth permission grant process.

  This url contains several important query parameters:

  client_id - aka. application id, the Square application which is requesting permissions.

  scope - s space-separated list of the permissions the application is requesting, different square api require different permissions.

  session - Suggest to set it to `false` all the time in production, only set it to `true` in sandbox

  state - we should set state value and verify the value in the callback to help protect against cross-site request forgery.

  Parameters
  ----------
  state : str
    The state value that will be verified in the authorizae callback.
